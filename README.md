# Dots

My dots. I like to spend time in my terminal, so most of the configs here are
about that.

### Terminal setup

- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)
- [Fish](https://fishshell.com/)
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

There are a few plugins, but for the most part this all hand-made. I know
Ghostty aims at making tmux redundant, but I like my scripts too much to give
them up.

### Window management

- [Aerospace](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide)
- [SketchyBar](https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/)

I'm a one-monitor guy -- just a laptop's screen. I use Aerospace to manage most
stuff; then there's SketchyBar because I like having an overview of the used
spaces.

### Theming

After many, many years of Monokai, I moved to
[Sonokai](https://github.com/sainnhe/sonokai), to great concern of my friends --
until they realized it barely made a difference.

But I like and so I applied it everywhere -- a bunch of the configs here do
nothing but apply the theme.
